# Lab LINQ

This lab will teach you how to work with LINQ

For this exercise you will **not** create the exercise from scratch. Instead you will update this given repository.

## Exercise

Implement all the empty methodes in the classes:

- NumbersHandler
- StudentHandler
- CardHandler (\*)

The name of each method describes what you must do. Each method also shows you (in comments) what the expected output should be or give you a little hint.

Run the handlers in Program.cs.

(\*) For the CardHandler you need to install Newtonsoft.Json:

```bash
>> dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

### When done:

Push the solution to your repository.

Have fun!
